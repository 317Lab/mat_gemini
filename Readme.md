# Gemini Matlab scripts

![ci](https://github.com/gemini3d/gemini-matlab/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

These scripts form the basic core needed to work with Gemini to:

* generate a new simulation from scratch
* read simulation output
* plot simulation

However, since the transition to Python, it was decided to move the Matlab scripts out to reduce maintenance effort.
They remain as a canonical known-working reference.
